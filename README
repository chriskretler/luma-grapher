The scripts directory consists of three classes of scripts:

- Identify scripts: find the points of edge over-enhancement via various means.
- Fix scripts: fix the points previously identified via various means.
- Plot scripts: create interactive plots of the original line, original overlay with identified points, and updated lines.

Examples:
1. Identify scripts:
python identify-max-min.py ../samples/Sather-line-352-original.txt

this analyzes the Sather original line and generates the points of over-enhancement.

2. Fix scripts: 
python fix-via-averaging.py ../samples/Sather-line-352-original.txt

This script assumes 'overshoot_points.txt' is in the same directory as the script itself, and uses that as input to remove over-enhancement from the input file.

3. Plot scripts:
python plot.py output.txt 

This script takes the 'overshoot_points.txt' and output file of the previous steps and plots them on a single overlay chart.
